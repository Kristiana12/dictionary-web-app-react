### Project Preview

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - For fetching Data
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned through this project is how to use the context API in react to pass data to other components, in my case I used it to change the theme and the font family of the App.

I experimented with styled components for the styling and with the axios library for fetching data.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about styled components, how to create reusable components with bet practices.
Of course I also want to improve my solutions with react as well.
